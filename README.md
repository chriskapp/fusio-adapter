Fusio-Adapter
=====

# About

This package provides a way to extend Fusio. In general a adapter defines a 
`definition.json` file which contains all informations. The adapter can provide 
new action and connection classes and create predefined routes, actions, 
schemas and connections. Take a look at the `definition-reference.json` file to 
see how a definition works. More informations about Fusio at
